Let's program the classic game, "Higher or Lower". Pick a random number between 1 and 100. Ask the user to guess
the number. Depending on their guess, print either "Higher", "Lower", or "You win!". Use a while loop and
if/elif/else statements.<br><br>
Hint: raw_input returns a string, randint returns an int.
